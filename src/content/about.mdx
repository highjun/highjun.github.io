I am a second year Ph.D. student in the *School of Computing* at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/).  


My research interests span Human-Computer Interaction (**HCI**) and eXplainable AI (**XAI**).
In particular, I'm willing to focus on **how AI models can enhance decision-making by effectively adapting to the userâ€™s way of thinking and leveraging personal context**.
This includes exploring how these models should explain their inner workings, and what kinds of structures best support transparency and effectiveness.


While this represents my primary research interest, *I remain enthusiastic about exploring interdisciplinary collaborations and related research domains.*
